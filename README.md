## Final Project: Open vs. Closed Innovation
*Benjamin Snow and Oliver Bott*

### Background

This is the repository for the 'Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis' course taught by [@christophergandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud) at the Hertie School of Governance.  This is the repository for the Final project, building off of two previous assignments which included a proposal and early data gathering, cleaning, and merging.    

This portion encapsulates all three assignments, and introduces the topic and literature, outlines our model and methods, displays our findings, and offers analysis and suggestions of early implications and calls for further research. 

The full assignment and repository include three main elements:

1. An academic research paper 
2. A website offering for public consumption and understanding
3. A presentation of the full project

These elements are included over a number of files and folders.  The repository includes:

- **Data folder**, including the files used for data gathering and merging as well as the full dataset of the project in Dataset.csv. Our final paper is dynamically linked to the .csv file to keep processing times to a minimum.
- **Presentation folder**,  including the presentation with our most important findings.
- **Website folder**, including our website files (website accessible via [this link](http://oliverbott.github.io/Final_Project/))
- **FinalProject.Rmd**, **.pdf** and **.html**, the final version of our project.
- **Main.bib** and **Packages.bib**, containing our main bibliography files.

## Final Project: Open vs. Closed Innovation
*Benjamin Snow and Oliver Bott*

### Background

This is the repository for the 'Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis' course taught by [@christophergandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud) at the Hertie School of Governance.  This is the repository for the Final project, building off of two previous assignments which included a proposal and early data gathering, cleaning, and merging.    

This portion encapsulates all three assignments, and introduces the topic and literature, outlines our model and methods, displays our findings, and offers analysis and suggestions of early implications and calls for further research. 

The full assignment and repository include three main elements:

1. An academic research paper 
2. A website offering for public consumption and understanding
3. A presentation of the full project

These elements are, however, included over a number of files and folders.  The full table of contents of the repository includes:

- Data Folder, which includes seven data gathering and merging related files, and the full dataset of the project in Dataset.csv
- Presentation folder, which includes several versions of the presentation.
- An ignore file
- FinalProject.Rmd, the main final project paper
- A license file
- Main.bib, a main bibliography file
- Packages.bib is a bibliographic file dynamically linked to FinalProject.Rmd with citations for R and R packages.
- A file which includes the code for a key map
- Readme.md, which includes the code for the document currently being read

The paper includes dynamically linked academic references (see Main.bib) and citations for R packages (see Packages.bib).

#### Project Paper File
The project Paper, as stated above, can be found in FinalProject.Rmd.

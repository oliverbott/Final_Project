# Abstract

This research project examines the potential benefit of using open knowledge data in the form of collaborative online network data as an innovation indicator. By doing so, this work critically assesses current innovation indicators, namely patent data, in the hope of offering new alternatives for measuring and understanding innovation. The stated research question is:  *To what extent can open innovation network data add to the measurement of innovation performance?* This study uses Github API follower data and patent data in 135 countries to compare the two, finding no correlation once controls were taken into account. However, several controls, including industrialization and the relative importance of a city in its national context were both found to be correlated to both patent data and open innovation data, suggesting that both types of innovation, if that is what patent and/or follower data were showing, bear fruit in similar circumstances. We suggest that, while the study does not conclusively determine a future metric for measuring open innovation or comparing types of innovation, it does suggest a potential expansion of the current field, which could potentially more accurately represent innovation in the open technological age.

## Introduction

Policy makers worldwide have a profound interest in innovation for its significance for economic development and prosperity. @taylor2004 views innovation as "the driving force behind modern economic growth, relative industrial power, and competitive advantage" (p.222). Numerous studies, for example the Innovation Union Scoreboard[^IUS] and the OECD Science, Technology and Innovation Scoreboard[^STI], have attempted to measure and compare innovation performance on the national level.  However, until today most examinations of innovation have put their analytical emphasis on national level patent data, relying on this form of registering of proprietary data as a means of measuring innovation.  However, intuitively the use of pantent data seems a limited view of innovation, as people only apply for patents as a means of protecting an idea for protection for commercial use. Many forms of innovation, with the key example being the opensource development of software, do not require or attempt government protection through patents, but would still be considered innovation. 

Thus the academic literature until this point leaves largely unexplored other, more open measures of innovation. The relatively recent emergence of network-based research systems offer new and potentially more instructive metrics by which to measure innovation, compared to protected closed knowledge. Since various scholars, called for the continuous improvement of innovation measurement [see for example @freeman2009], this work seeks to go beyond the widespread use of patent data to contribute to the refinement of innovation indicators, and the field as a whole.

## Literature Review

**Defining Innovation**

Using a rather grand view in his understanding of innovation, @schumpeter1942 sees innovation as "a process of industrial mutation, that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within". In a more understated characterization, @smith2005 defines innovation as "the creation of something qualitatively new, via processes of learning and knowledge building. It involves changing competences and capabilities, and producing qualitatively new performance outcomes" [@smith2005, 149]. While it is widely accepted that innovation can take many forms, e.g. product, process, marketing and proccess innovations, @frankelius2009, in his extensive literature review of innovation studies, criticizes the widespread underlying assumption that innovation is limited to technological innovation. While accepting @frankelius2009's critique of innovation as taking place outside of the technological realm, for the purpose of this study technological innovation, and specifically software innovation, will be the primary focus following relatively closely to @smith2005's definition.

**Measuring Innovation**

The frequent technological focus when studying innovation can partly be explained by the difficulties associated with innovation's measurement. @smith2005 notes the measurement challenge, as innovation is by definition a novelty and thus commensurability is a demanding task. For these reasons innovation has traditionally though controversially been measured by looking either at its inputs, outputs, our throughputs. Attempting to measure innovation by inputs often focuses on resources, such as personnel and equipment allocated to Research and Development, which @freeman2009 notes is often overestimating innovation in research and development by including the routine with the novel. Put another way, the use of Research and Development funding to assess innovation assumes innovation to takes place linearly with enough resources, as if the doubling of the number of Austrian patent office workers would have somehow resulted in two Albert Einstein's coming from their ranks, rather that just one.  @freeman2009 compares this with output oriented measures, which are often based on what he concludes are the already inadequate measures such as GDP. As @freeman2009 suggests, GDP is an oft cited imprecise statistical measure. However, building off of the first example, the use of output oriented measures the assumed result of innovation, economic growth, and not only assumes that the growth was based upon innovation, but seems to similarly assume that innovation creates value in a linear manner. A simple check of the wealth earned from various patents suggests this is not the case.  Thus both input measures, such as R&D funding, and output measures, such as GDP, both either to not directly measure innovation, or do so in a manner so broad as to be unhelpful 

An indicator most often found in innovation research is patent data [see @taylor2004]. A patent is a "temporary legal monopoly granted by the government to an inventor for the commerical use of the invention [@taylor2004, 229). A patent constitutes a property right awarded when an invention is shown to be non-trivial, useful, and novel [@taylor2004, 230]. Patents were first used to measure demand-side determinants of innovation, and have been used in the analysis of innovation activity for over three decades [@taylor2004, 230). @taylor2004 uses patent data taken from 1963 to 1999 in six different industries and their future citation levels and uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model to test what he terms the 'industry-innovation assumption'. The use of citations with patent data suggests a more nuanced examination of innovation using patent data that R&D fuding or GDP, as by using relative citation levels @taylor2004 was able to weight the relative importance of a patent.

**Limitations of Patent Data**

Despite the usefulness of patent data, @taylor2004 finds several limitations. In addition to the 'classification problem' related to assigning a specific industries to patents, patents vary widely in significance, both technically and economically [@taylor2004, 231]. Most significantly for the purpose on this study, @taylor2004 as well as @pakes1980 find that "patents are a flawed measure particularly since not all new innovations are patented and since patents differ greatly in their economic impact‚Äù (@taylor2004, 378). @taylor2004 to some degree is able to take into account the relative importance of different patents by taking into account their future citation level, a relatively good proxy for importance, he is less able to tackle the problem of new innovations which are not patented, with patent levels subsequently underrepresenting innovation. Thus, while for some considerable time patents have been considered to be the most effective proxy with which to measure innovation, they themselves ascribe to the notion that there is room for improvement in the study of innovation. This study stands as an attempt to further this field, to attempt to diliniate innovation which would not appear in patent data, but is instead based upon open network data.

**Using Network Data as Innovation Indicator**

Current developments in research indicate that "characteristics that were important last century may well no longer be so relevant today and indeed may even be positively misleading" [@freeman2009, 3]. A shift away from the belief that innovation only occurs in professional R&D labs has occured, a change towards what @freeman2009 calls "research without frontiers" (p.13). Even though networks and research collaborations become increasingly important, there have been relatively few studies focusing on network data [see @breschi2005]. Even where research networks have been analyzed, the focus is too often on economically useful knowledge [see @acs2002]. Other studies focusing on research networks focus on other protected collaborative networks [see @ponds2010]. In an exception to this standard, @senghore2014 attempt to answer whether social network statistics act as indicators of innovation performance within a network, and which statistics could predict innovation performance.  Using @Gnyawali2013's use models on cluster and network effects to analyze multipartite social networks at mass collaboration events, gathering their data from NASA's International Space Apps Challenge.  They use graph theory models constructed from affiliation networks finding (preliminarily) that distributions likely correlate to key aspects [@senghore2014].

Since @freeman2009 among others calls for the continuous improvement of innovation measurement, this work seeks to contribute to the refinement of innovation indicators. The purpose of this study is to explore the conceptual and statistical viability of a new metric by which we can measure innovation. 

# Research Question

In light of the above mentioned state of innovation research we plan to examine the following research question:  
*To what extent can open innovation network data add to the measurement of innovation performance?*
Exploiting technological advances related to the increasing use of the internet and open research platforms like GitHub, we plan to explore whether open knowledge networks can help refine currently limited innovation performance measurements.

# Data and Data Limitations

To examine open network data against patent data, this study will rely largely on two data sets and use the statistical tool R [@CiteR] for the data analysis.

**API network data**

The first data set is obtained by using the Application Programming Interface (API) data for open networks. To examine open data innovation, data is obtained from the the git repository web-based hosting service GitHub[^GIT]. GitHub is a web-based hosting service used for collaborative research. Its use of source code management makes it a commonly used software development collaboration tool. Since most of the repositories are openly accessible one can use API tools to track the popularity of contributors through a process called following. 

For the analysis, first we will create location vectors for different cities with the `locations` code. Since many GitHub users can be located, we will identify different open innovation clusters, for example Berlin, New York and San Francisco. In addition, we use the `vector()` code to get information on user counts, focusing on users with more than 20 or so followers. By combining locations and user counts data by using `data.frame()`, we are able to construct data sets for different location clusters and user count numbers, where users of highly relevant followers are located.

**Closed innovation OECD patent data**

For closed innovation we use city-level patent data, taken from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development[^OECD]. The R [@CiteR] package [@R-rsdmx] is necessary for obtaining the OECD dataset. Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent data are used to track internationally patented inventions. We took patent data of 135 cities overall, ranging from sixteen different countries, including their country level patent data, for general comparison over the time period 2000 until 2012. As we are interested in patent data, we work with data indicating the PCT patent applications per 10,000 inhabitants. From the same database, we also use GDP per capita data and environmental data, as other variables thought potentially relevant in explaining differences in innovation.

All data obtained via the GitHub API and OECD database can be linked to individual cities (n=130) in a total of 16 countries, allowing for an analysis on the regional level. The code used for gathering and cleaning the data is stored in a separate .R file and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/oliverbott/Assignment3/blob/master/Data_Gathering.R).

**Other Variables**

Several potential explanatory variables are collected besides the patent and GitHub data. These variables were selected as they were thought to potentially show cause for why innovation, be it open or closed, occurs in a certain city, but needed to be variables that would not introduce endogeneity to the model. 

**Greenspace**: The Greenspace indicator is deemed potentially relevant in that with a choice of city to innovate in (assuming some level of geographic labor flexibility) there might be a recreational value necessary for attracting talent. Put another way, green cities could attract innovators.

**Pollution**: The Pollution indicator is taken both as a broad proxy for industrialization (leaving aside a discussion of to what degree pollution is from industry vs cars), that it seemed worth exploring whether a certain level of pollution discouraged talent attraction of innovators on the city-level.

**Employment**: The Employment indicator is taken largely as an indication of that city¬¥s significance within its national context. Understanding whether a city would likely be viewed as the most prominent or significant, and whether this effects innovation, or whether innovation takes place in smaller provincial cities, is worther understanding.  Additionally, seeing if the type of innovation (open vs. closed) depends on the significance of the city is viewed as relevant.

**GDP**: A GDP indicator explores whether the size of the economy, or wealth generally, is related to innovation on the city-level, and if it is indicator of one type of innovation over another.

**Population**: A Population variable explores whether there is a necessary city size threshold which corresponds to innovation, and also is taken for controlling for across cities, to find patent data or GitHub data per a number of people in a city.

**Data Limitations**

As can be seen in the Table below, the analysis is based on cross-sectional data with varying time frames. There are several limitations to the data used in this study. First, the time discrepency between different aspects of the data used, which range from 2005 to 2014, reflect an obvious data comparability constraint. Secondly, in this analysis for data availability and access reasons, there are some prominent innovation hubs excluded, including San Fransisco and New York. Third, several variables used, with pollution being the most obvious example, while numerically accurate, act as at best a rough proxy for the meaning (industrialization) attributed to them. Any found significance will need to take this into account. Last, and perhaps most significantly, when comparing the two measures of innovation, it should be noted that patent data reflects innovation across all types of sectors, whereas Github data mainly reflects innovation within the software technology domain.

# Methodology

**Descriptive Statistics**

The summary statistics in Table 2 show wide ranging distributions of the observations in the data set. Since the data cleaning eliminated all values equal to or lower than zero, a log transformation seems to be a strategy that could strengthen the analysis. The *car* package [@R-car] is used to examine the relationship, distribution, and normality of all variables included in the model, to understand which regression model would be most appropriate. The distribution of many variables are highly skewed (see Figure 1). The GitHub based variables have significant right skews, as do nearly all of the observed variables, excluding Pollution, GDP and Patents, which come closer to a normal distribution. It seems as if already in the scatterplot a slight correlation between Patents and Followers can be observed. To normalize for the skewed distributions, the log of the variables is deemed necessary to increase the explanatory power of our inferential statistics. 

**Model**

This study uses an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to examine the relationship between patent and highly followed open data sources. The general models for the regression analysis can be viewed as:

1. $logFol_{i} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 logPat_{i} + {\beta}_2 Controls_{i} +{\epsilon}_{i}$

2. $logPat_{i} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 logFol_{i} + {\beta}_2 Controls_{i} +{\epsilon}_{i}$

Here *logPat* and *logFol* on the left hand side of each model represent the patent or follower intensity expected in a given city *i*, with various controls included to attempt to account for the various type or types of innovation found.  


# Results

(Here I think we can use almost everything verbatim from the website text, but didn't want to pull in the text and code chunks since you mentioned this could create problems)

 
# Conclusions

The findings endorse the implicit hypothesis of the study that open data sources seem to show innovation in a similar but perhaps distinct manner to patent data and could hence enrich the measurement of innovation. While no relationship was found between patent data and follower data, it remains an open question whether this means that follower data is a poor measurement for innovation while patent data is, or whether potentially they measure a different type of innovation. It seems plausible that github data offers a glimps into the 'throughput' of open innovation (in the form of collaboration) rather than the 'output' which patent data reflects (in the form of commercialization of knowledge). It could be that patent data better takes into account the exact moment and type of innovation, as it is tied to the patent application itself, whereas someone could choose to follow someone based upon other reasoning than their level of innovation. 

Interestingly, as the strongest relationships were found not between patent and follower data, but rather between these two variables and the city related control variables, that many of the conditions which foster both open and closed innovation, in this case industrialization and city importance, both positively affect the drive of innovation in a city. Due to these parallels, it seems plausible that policy makers could institute similar reforms to positively affect both.
